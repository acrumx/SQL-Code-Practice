-- Solved in PostgreSQL
-- Link to problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/


-- The below query passes the first test, but not the final submission test cases.
-- 13/15 of the test cases are passed and this fails because it does not actually
-- check that the <u>revious day</u> (key word 'previous day) is a lower temp.
-- the query is only checking that the previou record, ordered by the recordDate
-- column holds a lower temperature. This means if the date is not 1 day before the
-- current one, we will still receive a record because the logic is not going by 
-- day to day. We need to compare records that are of consecutive dates (1 day after)

SELECT id from (
    Select 
    id,
    recordDate, temperature,
    LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS previous_value
FROM Weather) as ranked
where temperature > previous_value;


-- A good way to solve this in order to get your desired result is by using 
-- DATEDIFF(day, recordDate, )

-- This is a work in progress 
SELECT id from (
  Select
  id, 
  recordDate, 
  temperature,
  DATEDIFF(
)
